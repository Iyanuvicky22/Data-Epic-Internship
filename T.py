# # Create a Class:
# Define a class named TodoList.
# 
# 
# ### Methods to Implement:
# 
# ```Add Task:``` A method to add a new task to the todo list.
# 
# ```Delete Task:``` A method to delete a task from the todo list.
# 
# ```Show All Tasks:``` A method to display all tasks in the todo list.
# Mark Task as Completed: A method to mark a task as completed.
# 
# ```Version Control:```
# Make sure to make commits of your task to the Data Epic organization Git repository. Check for a reminder on how to do that in ‚Å†task-submission
# Follow proper commit messages and structure for your commits.
# 
# ```Deadline:```
# The task is due by Friday at 12pm.

# #### Task Details
# 
# ```Create a Base Class:```Define a base class called Item that will have common attributes and methods which can be inherited. For example, each item might have a description and a status (completed or not).
# 
# ```Extend the Item Class:```
# Create two derived classes from Item:
# 
# *Task:* Represents a regular task. Include specific attributes or methods that apply only to tasks.
# 
# *Event:* Represents a calendar event. Add attributes like event date and start/end times.
# 
# ```Implement Polymorphism:```
# Override a common method in both derived classes, such as a method to display the item details. Each class should format the details in a way that is appropriate for its type.
# For example, tasks might show completion status, while events show the date and time.
# 
# ```Modify TodoList Class:```
# Adapt the TodoList class to handle both Tasks and Events. Ensure that methods such as add_item, delete_item, and show_items are polymorphic and handle different item types correctly.
# 
# ``Main Method:``
# Ensure your application includes a main method that initializes the TodoList and allows users to interact with it. This will make your application modular and easier to run.
# 
# #### Example Scenario:
# Your Todo List can now handle both tasks like "Finish the OOP assignment" and events like "Team meeting on Zoom at 3 PM on Friday".
# When showing items, the output should reflect the type of item and its specific attributes.
